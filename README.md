# The Odin Project & Project Euler: Problem 1

### Created by: Tim Lapinskas

This project was created in conjunction with and guided by [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101).

I definitely had some trouble putting together the Javascript concepts on the first go around, but after taking a quick peak at some of the other students answers for inspiration, I came up with two of my own. The same basic concepts are applied to both. The first allows the user to enter an upper limit by calling the function in the console, while the second prompts the user to enter a number and prints the answer at the end.

Looking forward to tackling some of the other Project Euler problems.

Cheers,
Tim
