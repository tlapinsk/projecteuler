# The Odin Project & Project Euler: Problem 1

### Created by: Tim Lapinskas

This project was created in conjunction with and guided by [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101).

I definitely had some trouble putting together the Javascript concepts at first, but after taking a quick peak at some of the other students answers for inspiration, I came up with two of my own. The same basic concepts are applied to both, but one allows the user to enter an upper limit by calling the function in the console. While, the second prompts the user to enter a number and alerts prints the answer at the end.

I'll definitely be checking out the other Project Euler problems to keep my critical thinking skills sharp.

Cheers,
Tim
